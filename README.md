# 🐸 Frogosaur: The Last Hungry Frog

A fast-paced arcade game where you play as a mutant frog trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic sewer! Use your elastic tongue to catch prey and your powerful bounce ability to navigate through dangerous environments.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **Left Click (while stuck)** - Launch yourself as a projectile in the direction of your mouse

When you're stuck to a surface, click to launch yourself! You'll bounce off walls and obstacles. After a few bounces, you'll stick to whatever you land on.
